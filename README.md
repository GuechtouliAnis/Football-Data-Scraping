# Football Data Scraper

## Overview
This repository contains a Python notebook designed for scraping football data from various sources. The main goal of this project is to collect detailed player statistics from the past season to create a comprehensive football database for further analysis.

## Introduction

This is my first attempt at building a football database. As a data science student in college, I am passionate about football and data analysis, and this project is a step towards combining these interests. By collecting and analyzing data from past football seasons, I aim to uncover insights and trends that can be useful for various applications in the football industry.

## Key Features

### Player Statistics
Detailed statistics for players, including their performance in various areas like defense, goalkeeping, passing, shooting, and more.

### Data Organization
The data is organized into multiple tables, each focusing on a specific aspect of the game, such as defense, goalkeeping, passing types, and playing time.

### Comprehensive Analysis
The collected data can be used for in-depth analysis and research, providing insights into player performance and team dynamics.

## Leagues Contained

The data covers various leagues split by country. The leagues included are only those that contain all the detailed data that FBref provides. Leagues that do not have advanced stats such as passing and pass types are not included.

### European Leagues
- **England** : Premier League & Championship (EFL)
- **Spain** : La Liga & Segunda Division
- **Italy** : Serie A & Serie B
- **Germany** : Bundesliga & 2. Bundesliga
- **France** : Ligue 1 & Ligue 2
- **Portugal** : Primeira Liga
- **Netherlands** : Eredivisie
- **Belgium** : Pro League

### American Leagues
- **USA** : MLS (east & west)
- **Argentina** : Primera Division
- **Brazil** : Serie A (Brazilian League)
- **Mexico** : Liga MX

*Note that Brazil's 1st division is called "Serie A" too but was changed to "Brazilian League" to avoid confusion*
